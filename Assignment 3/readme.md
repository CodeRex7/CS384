You  should  write  two  different  algorithms  (using  subset  sum
paradigm    and    ordering    paradigm)    and    compare    their
performance by varying knapsack capacity from
1 to maximum
size (Twice the sum of all weights of individual items)


Implementing a data generator was slightly difficult hence data was sourced from 
=======
1. 0-1 Knapsack Problem using Greedy Algorithm
2. Binomial Coefficient computation
