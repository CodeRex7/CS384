Write a program that computes optimal solution to the 0â€“1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming? You may test your program with the following example:
There are n = 5 objects with integer weights w[1..5] = {1,2,5,6,7}, and values v[1..5] = {1,6,18,22,28}.  Assuming a knapsack capacity of 11).
