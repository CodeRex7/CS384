# Dynamic 0-1 Knapsack Problem

Write a program that computes optimal solution to the 0â€“1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming. You may test your program with the following example:

There are n = 5 objects with integer weights w[1:5] = {1,2,5,6,7} and values v[1:5] = {1,6,18,22,28}. The knapsack has a maximum capacity of 11.
