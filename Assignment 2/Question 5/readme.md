# Matrix Multiplication Analysis

Practical implementation of Strassensâ€™s matrix multiplication algorithm  usually switch to the brute force method after matrix sizes become smaller than some crossover point. Run an experiment to determine such crossover point on your computer system.


Implementation notes:
Classical algorithm implemented. Padding not included.
