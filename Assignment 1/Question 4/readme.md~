# Question 4

Compare the performance of variants of quick sort algorithm for instance characteristic n=10, ..., 1000. Use the results of Question 3 [cross-over point where insertion sort shows the better performance over quick sort] and accordingly modify your implemented quick sorting algorithm use insertion sort when the size of the sublist is 12 or less.  The counter will now have to count compares in both the partition function and in each iteration of insertion sort.  Rerun the experiment for 50 iterations and record the same set of statistics and compare the results for the two different sorting techniques and comment upon the results obtained.
