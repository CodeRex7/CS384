# Question 5

The two way insertion sort is a modification of the classical insertion sort. A separate output array of size 2n+1 is set aside. Initially the first element is placed into the middle  of the “sorted” array. Insertion on either end is continued until an insertion in between a pair must be done. As before shifting must be performed, but unlike before, shifting can be done in any direction since there is additional room on both sides of the array. Compare the performance of two way insertion sort with quick sort.
