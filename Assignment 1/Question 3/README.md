# Question 3
Determine the asymptotic behaviour of at least 5 internal sorting algorithms for each of the following input variations:
1. Random data
2. Reverse Ordered Data
3. Almost Sorted Data
4. Highly Repetitive Data

Select a suitable number of elements for the analysis that supports your program.


To run the code, all methods must be placed within the same folder. They have been sorted into different folders for sake of clarity.

Note: Radix Sort has not been implemented and can be left out.
